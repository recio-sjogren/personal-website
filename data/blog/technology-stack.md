I am redesigning my personal site with the main goal of having a better surface area for reading. I will bump into plenty of hurdles but I’m looking forward to figuring things out 🚀

I won’t cover which headless CMS I am planning to use to draft, edit and publish content. Finding one terrifies me so if you have any low-config recommendations [please give me a shout on Twitter](https://twitter.com/recio_sjogren).

Anyways, keep reading to find out more about the three technologies that I have set on to build my new site:

1. **Next.js:** My React framework of choice.
2. **Tailwindcss.** A glorious utility-first CSS framework.
3. **Vercel.** For hosting and seamless git-based deployments.

## Next.js ✨

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the React framework that I am using to build the website. It provides a great ‘developer experience’ and comes with a set of built-in features that make the lives of newbies like me easier. Here are my top 4 features 👇

- **Zero config →** _I don’t need to worry about code compilation and bundling._ This is done automatically with Webpack and babel.

- **Fast refresh →** Also known as ‘hot reloading’ it gives me instantaneous feedback on edits made to the React components.

- **Production-ready code →** This is a killer 🙂. Any Next.js application is ready for production from the start.

- **Static-generation →** The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. Aka, incredibly fast.

## Tailwindcss ✨

[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework intended to ease up styling web applications. I have been playing with Tailwind on a project that I am building with a programmer friend of mine for the past couple of months and I’m all in.

Some people call it a “utility bundle” and I like that. Instead of providing predefined UI components, Tailwindcss comes with a set of utility classes (constraint primitives) that you then use to build your components.

This approach comes with some downsides (your HTML pages will get cluttered) but I feel that the benefits of styling your web app without the need to writing custom CSS or leaving the comfort zone of your HTML code outweighs its drawbacks. Here is a nice quote from a pro:

> If I had to recommend a way of getting into programming today, it would be HTML + CSS with Tailwind CSS.

## Vercel ✨

And finally, I will be using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to take care of deployments and hosting. Deploying and hosting websites is a breeze nowadays compared to days of FTPing your files over to servers.

There are a number of services playing in this space. They integrate seamlessly to version control systems like GitHub and will kickstart their deployment process every single change the master branch. As I read somewhere yesterday, **today deployments are just a git push away.**

I was using Netlify on my previous site but as Next.js was created by the team behind Vercel, I have decided to give them a go 👋

That’s all. I enjoyed writing this post.

Thanks for reading,
