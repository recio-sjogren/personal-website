As the time passes, products will grow and evolve due to the new features added to it by the engineering teams. These new features are built with the hope that they will be well received by our customers.

Now, are all the features in your product actually been used by your users? Of course they are not. You probably have a couple that everyone uses while the rest go unnoticed. Here is how the story goes ðŸ‘‡:

Letâ€™s say you originally built a product with solid document editing features. That initial success made you believe that you could do lots more. You built a calendar which was barely used (no one created events) and a messenger which only certain customers interacted with.

Not great. This is your product and you need to fix it.

##Â Introducing feature audits

Before adding extra features to your product I would take a look at how is people actually using my product.

You could run a few SQL queries or use a an analytics product like Mixpanel or Amplitude to collect this data and then do a feature audit by plotting out all your features on two axes:

1. Number of people that use the feature â†’.

2. And how often is the feature used â†‘.

Number of people that use the feature â†’.

And how often is the feature used â†‘.

Plot your features in a chart with two axis
Exclude admin features like account creation or password reset as they are not relevant for this exercise.

The features that appear on the top right ðŸ‘‰ are the ones that everyone uses all the time. That is the core value of your product. That is what people is actually using your product for.

The features that appear on the top left ðŸ‘‰ are the ones with poor adoption. Those are features that a small amount of people is using all the time.

Another way to think about this is: What percentage of your customers have adopted each feature? To illustrate this you only need a simple bar chart.

A dream product has features that are frequently used by a broad section of your users. That is the product we all think we are creating when mocking up prototypes.

The messy reality is that you probably have a couple of features that everyone uses. Another couple are a ghost town. And the vast majority falling somewhere in between.

What should you do next?
For any given feature with limited adoption, you have four choices:

Kill it - Admit defeat and start removing them from your product

Increase the adoption rate - Find a way to get more people to use it.

Get people to use the feature more often

Deliberately improve it â€“ Make it quantifiably better for those who do use it.

I will go into these specific topics in future issues of this newsletter. We will look at things like how to increase product engagement, how to improve distribution an how to optimise products iteratively using our customerâ€™s input as the compass for feature prioritisation and product development.
