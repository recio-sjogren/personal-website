For my first technology post, I have decided to write about a book about philosophy. Hang in there with me. I am reading [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) by the great Robert M. Pirsig.

Considered a self-discovery classic, at par with Kerouacâ€™s _On the road_ or Herman Hesseâ€™s _Siddhartha_, the book tells the story of a motorcycle trip across North America by a father with his 11-year-old and another couple.

Beyond the story about the road trip (which I already like) what hit a chord deep inside of me are the reflections that the writer shares about the **different approaches that people have towards technology**, all this seen through the lenses of motorcycle maintenance, of course ðŸ˜€

## What is your stance towards technology?

On the one hand, we have Robert, who performs his own maintenance. He gets his hands dirty and takes the time to understand his motorbike. He kind of represents the systematic thinking that an engineer or mechanic goes through with logic to identify issues on his motorbike ðŸ‘€.

The couple, on the other hand, sees the mechanical side of their machine as an alien entity that they rather have professionals do. They value aesthetics over practical applications and see life as creative, unpredictable and chaotic. Ironically, as the trip unfolds, they canâ€™t help but find themselves entangled with issues from the motorbike that they travel on ðŸ˜³

## Aim for the middle ground ðŸ˜€

As a [Triumph motorcycle owner](https://www.instagram.com/p/BysiXNxHuXv/) (I rode from London to Zahara de los Atunes to attend my own wedding) and a technologist (I design and build websites and mobile apps for a living), I can see where Robert is coming from.

Taking the time to understand the inner workings of the most critical (or annoying) objects, systems, processes that we interact with on a day-to-day basis pays dividends in the long run.

Thankfully, the two mindsets described by the book are merely extremes from a spectrum that can actually be reconciled! For instance, I didnâ€™t grow up with an interest in technology or mechanics even though I could now probably dismantle my entire bike.

Once we leave any preconceived images of ourselves behind, we can blend curiosity creativity and intuition with reason and science as sources of wisdom to increase our quality of life.

Thanks for reading,
