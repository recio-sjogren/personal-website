This weekend my wife and I watched a film titled [The Great Indian Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_E6ctiFn6I&ab_channel=GOODWILLENTERTAINMENTS). Here is a link to the trailer. The film follows the steps of a woman that marries into a â€˜respectableâ€™ middle-class home and soon after the arranged wedding ends, she slowly but surely finds herself confined to the kitchen.

_It is painful to watch._

You instantly feel sorry for her and detest the male characters in the film. There are endless shots focusing on her hands as she cooks, grinds, cleans, wipes and disposes of greasy waste. She literally becomes a subdued servant (and Iâ€™ll stop here so you can go ahead and watch the movie).

_And now back to us men._

Having been raised in Western culture, I quickly empathised with the young woman and felt disgusted at how she was being treated. Then, as we continued watching, my wife kindly mentioned that, in a way, my attitude towards housework and childcare was also a sign of sexism ðŸ˜³

I swallowed the pill. Tried to counterattack. Got nowhere. Reflected. And ultimately agreed ðŸ˜Œ

For context. We are ex-pats living in London. We both have demanding jobs and a 1.5-year-old daughter. No extended family around. It is fun. We survived the pandemic. It is also hard work.

Now, while I participate in the list of tasks needed to keep our household going (cooking, washing clothes, buying groceries, tidying up the house), my participation doesnâ€™t have the same level of responsibility. Relentless execution relies on her.

This is a type of sexism that I can see now. The movie helped me to scrub the surface of my own assumed values about gender equality. I would encourage you to do the same. Watching this movie might help. Scrub them off now and then. Let the light in.

Thanks for reading,
