This weekend my wife and I watched a film titled [The Great Indian Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_E6ctiFn6I&ab_channel=GOODWILLENTERTAINMENTS). The film follows the steps of a woman that marries into a â€˜respectableâ€™ middle-class home and as the wedding ends _she slowly but surely finds herself confined to the kitchen_.

As a person that instinctively tries to avoid housework (in my wife's words), _I found the film quite painful to watch_. I felt sorry for the lady and instantly developed a resentment towards the male characters in the film. There are several slow-mo scenes that focus the camera on her hands as she cooks, grinds, cleans, wipes and disposes of greasy waste.

Having been raised in a Western culture, I quickly empathised with the young woman and felt disgusted at how she was being treated. Then, as we continued watching, my wife kindly mentioned that, in a way, my loose attitude towards housework and childcare also was a kind of sexism ðŸ˜³

> I swallowed the pill. Tried to counterattack. Reflected. And ultimately agreed ðŸ˜Œ

For context. We are ex-pats living in London. We both have demanding jobs and a 1.5-year-old daughter. No extended family around. It is fun. We survived the pandemic. It is also hard work.

Now, while I mildly participate in the list of tasks needed to keep our household going (cooking, washing clothes, buying groceries, tidying up the house), my contribution doesnâ€™t share the same level of responsibility. _The relentless force that runs our family home relies on my wife_.

The movie helped me to scrub the surface of my own assumed values about gender equality. I would recommend any of you to [watch the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_E6ctiFn6I&ab_channel=GOODWILLENTERTAINMENTS) and consider where you line lies on housework matters.

Thanks for reading,
