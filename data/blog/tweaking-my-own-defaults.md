![Tweaking my own defaults](/static/images/tweaks.png)

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been following (stalking) a group of programmers/designers/founders/indy makers/writers. They all happen to be Italian and they are smashing it! The inspiration for my post today actually comes from Fabrizio Rinaldi, the co-founder of Mailbrew.

Fabrizio talks about the **default effect** and how we can apply that to our daily lives.

> The default effect states that people usually just accept the default option, even if better options are at arms’ reach.  
> In product design, it’s extremely important to keep this effect in mind, since giving wrong defaults could in some cases give the wrong impression that the product doesn’t work or isn’t useful.  
> Having a certain breakfast every day, starting to work at a certain time, getting your news on some website, and taking a walk in a specific place are all **things that can become defaults easily, making you completely ignore far better alternatives.**

A super interesting idea. The things we do, and the way in which we do them, have a strong effect on us when looked at on aggregate.

Similarly, we can intentionally change them to improve our outcomes on aggregate. I have looked back and try to identify things that on the one hand bring me the most suffering and on the other I haven’t managed to improve:

1. I have suffered from anxiety and dispersion for a long time.
2. I have longed to be more public (writing) for a long time.

So, having agreed that we are what we do, I have decided to address the two issues above by **amending my defaults.** Four daily activities that I am planning to do on a daily basis (weekends off) to improve my wellbeing (anxiety) and become a better writer/storyteller.

In order of importance:

- 😌 Meditating for 30 minutes every day
- ✍️ Writing a 200-250 word post every day
- 🏋️‍♂️ Light exercise every day (15-20 minutes)
- 🐣Writing 2 tweets a day ([You can follow me here](https://twitter.com/recio_sjogren))

This post was supposed to be my 200-250 word post 🤷‍♂️

Thanks for reading,

Ps. I have gone old-school to track progress. Hoping to see lots of black dots at the end of each month 👇
